Olist Store Analysis: Key Insights via KPIs
In this project, I delve into the Olist Store dataset, leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs) to unearth valuable insights for the e-commerce platform. My analysis focuses on five crucial areas:

Weekday vs. Weekend Payment Statistics: By examining purchase patterns across weekdays and weekends, I aim to understand peak sales periods, optimize marketing strategies, and tailor logistics accordingly.
Positive Reviews and Credit Card Payments: Assessing the correlation between five-star reviews and credit card usage can reveal valuable customer segments and inform targeted payment processing solutions.
Pet Shop Delivery Lead Time: Analyzing the average delivery time for pet shop products allows for identifying efficiency gaps and streamlining logistics to enhance customer satisfaction.
Sao Paulo Customers: Price and Payment Behavior: This KPI delves into purchase tendencies of Sao Paulo customers, uncovering average price points and preferred payment methods, which can inform localized pricing strategies and promotional campaigns.
Delivery Speed and Review Scores: By investigating the relationship between shipping speed and review scores, I aim to gauge the impact of timely deliveries on customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in logistics and communication.
This multi-faceted analysis provides Olist Store with actionable insights to optimize operations, marketing, and customer experiences, ultimately driving growth and success in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
